# SafeHouse-Kotlin 

Using Kotlin

A SINGLE SCREEN App which fetches data from an open web service -
The Breaking Bad Api. Data required to be fetched is a single api which contains
all the information of the actors/characters in the series.

Functionalities:
        1. MVVM - maintain fetching and storage logic in a ViewModel (1st priority)
        
        2. UI requirements (2nd priority)
            - The single screen will contain a grid of items where each item is each actor's large portrait image. So, the app when launched displays a scrollable grid with at least 2 items horizontally arranged.
            
            - Whenever the user long presses the image item in the grid,
              The Character's name and the actor's name appears in a short duration toast.
             (Try to keep the text in white or with a dark background also so that it's visible over the images)

        3. use of Coil library for image processing (preferred but still Optional)
